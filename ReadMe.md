Superpixel is a polygonal part of a digital image, larger than a normal pixel, that is rendered in the same color and brightness. Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in computer vision applications. They have become key building blocks of computer vision algorithms. It is not always defined what constitutes a good superpixels algorithm. However, there are few algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact superpixels with a low computational overhead. We, performed analysis of state-of-the-art superpixel methods like TP09, GS04, QS08, evaluating their speed, adhere to image boundaries. But, no existing methods were providing our desirable properties. We, implemented superpixels using simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts k-means clustering. This method is easy to use, offers flexibility in compactness and number of superpixels it generates, and is freely available
